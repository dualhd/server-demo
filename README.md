# Dual HD server demo
This is an example server setup demonstrating real-time cropping of a [Dual HD](https://dualhd.org/) stream using [Mediamtx](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx).

## What is Dual HD?
Dual HD is a video standard that contains both horizontal and vertical view within a single frame. Dual HD 2640, used in this example, contains Full HD (1920Ã—1080) video for horizontal and 720p (720x1280) for vertical video.

Dual HD is designed for streaming across platforms like Twitch/YouTube (horzontal) and TikTok/Instagram (vertical).

## Purpose of this repository
This repo is useful for testing and demonstrating Dual HD and it provides a working example of:

- Simulating a Dual HD livestream from a PNG image to Mediamtx server using FFmpeg
- Automatically cropping the Dual HD video into horizontal and vertical outputs, that can be read via RTMP

## Prerequisites
Docker Desktop (or Docker CLI + Docker Compose)

## How to run this example

**1\. Clone this repository and start the server**

```sh
docker compose up
```
This will start a MediaMTX server with routing rules for horizontal and vertical crops.


**2\. Simulate a live Dual HD stream**

```sh
ffmpeg -loop 1 -framerate 30 -i dualhd2640.png \
    -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -r 30 -f flv rtmp://localhost:1935/dualhd2640
```
This turns dualhd2640.png into a 30fps live stream.


**3\. Watch the output streams**

You can view the output streams using [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) or similar software:
  - Horizontal view: rtmp://localhost:1935/horizontal
  - Vertical view: rtmp://localhost:1935/vertical
